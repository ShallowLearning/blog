Getting started is definitely half the battle -- it took me a solid two days of struggling with [Pelican][1], [Jinja2][2], and other pieces of software to even get this blog off the ground. It was a great learning experience though, and I am excited to start what I hope is a long -- maybe inconsistent -- habit of putting my projects on the web.

I plan to use this blog to share my thoughts on various topics in data science: analytics, visualization, and applied mathematics (i.e. Machine Learning). You should expect to find most of the programming examples written in Python or C++; however, I want to expand to include Javascript, Scala and Go in the near future. For example, I might do a write-up on a deep neural-network I wrote in Python. I want to keep the focus on practical cases with explanations on how to build algorithms and mathematical models to visualize/analyze real world data.

I would love to get anyones comments about the blog posts and any suggestions for new tutorials. 

    ::::python
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        print 'Hello, World!'
